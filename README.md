# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS


Image processing involves some basic operations namely image restoration/rectification, 
image enhancement, image classification, images fusion etc. Image classification forms an 
important part of image processing. The objective of image classification is the automatic 
allocation of image to thematic classes. Two types of classification are supervised 
classification and unsupervised classification. The process of image classification involvestwo 
steps, training of the system followed by testing. The training process means, to take the 
characteristic properties of the images (form a class) and form a unique description for a 
particular class. The process is done for all classes depending on the type of classification 
problem; binary classification or multi-class classification. The testing step means to 
categorize the test images under various classes for which system was trained. This assigning 
of class is done based on the partitioning between classes based on the training features. Since 
2006, deep structured learning, or more commonly called deep learning or hierarchical 
learning, has emerged as a new area of machine learning research. Several definitions are 
available for Deep Learning; coating one of the many definitions from Deep Learning is 
defined as: A class of machine learning techniques that exploit many layers of non-linear 
information processing for supervised or unsupervised feature extraction and transformation 
and for pattern analysis and classification. This work aims at the application ofConvolutional 
Neural Network or CNN for image classification. The image data used for testing the algorithm 
includes remote sensing data of aerial images and scene data from SUN database. The rest of 
the paper is organized as follows. It deals with the working of the network followed with 
theoretical background. The working of CNN is described in further which gives the 
experimental procedure in detail. Finally, it deals with the experimental results obtained using 
CNN.
